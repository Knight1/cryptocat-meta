			<h1>Cryptocat Is an Experiment in Progress</h1>
			<p><strong>Cryptocat is not yet ready to be used in extreme situations.</strong> Don't rely on Cryptocat if your life is threatened â€” it's experimental software. But that doesn't mean that Cryptocat can't provide reliable, useful privacy for many individuals. Here are just a few examples:</p><br />
			<h1>Who Uses Cryptocat?</h1>
			<br />
			<div class="user">

				<h2>Friends & Family</h2>
				<p>Cryptocat means to be as accessible as any other web Instant Messaging platform, while also offering a transparent layer of security. This makes it an ideal alternative to invasive services for talking with friends and family.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="user">
				<img src="img/user_lgbtq.png" alt="" />
				<h2>LGBTQ Community</h2>
				<p>Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender and Queer communities worldwide have used Cryptocat in order to discuss matters related to sexual counselling and politics away from the public eye. Cryptocat is perfect for this scenario where a little more privacy is required..</p>
			</div>
			<div class="user">
				<img src="img/user_nonprofit.png" alt="" />
				<h2>Nonprofits</h2>
				<p>Nonprofit organizations regularly require private communications, but often deal with parties that aren't ready to set up and use conventional encryption software. Cryptocat makes it easy for your nonprofit to communicate with its clients privately.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="user">
				<img src="img/user_media.png" alt="" />
				<h2>Media</h2>
				<p>It's easy for media organizations to run their own local Cryptocat servers, making internal communication easily secure. A drop-in solution, Cryptocat offers the private communications media and journalists need without sacrificing ease of use.</p>

				<h1>What is Cryptocat?</h1>
				<p>Cryptocat is free software that aims to provide an open, accessible Instant Messaging environment with a transparent layer of encryption that works right in your browser.</p>

				<p>Cryptocat aims to leverage both the ease of use and accessibility afforded by web applications and the security provided by client-side cryptography to offer group instant messaging, encrypted file sharing, and more.
				<br /><br />
				<h1>Why Privacy Matters</h1>
				<p><strong>Cryptocat is developed by privacy advocates, for privacy advocates.</strong> Big Data providers such as Google and Facebook continue to amass gigantic amounts of personal information without providing any guarantee of privacy, while encryption remains largely inaccessible. This means that a lot of what you do online is not within your control, but rather susceptible to governmental or corporate interception.</p>
				<p><strong>Cryptocat aims to bridge the gap for those who need encrypted communications that are easily accessible.</strong></p>
