			<h1>Cryptocat lets you chat with privacy.</h1>

				We're developing an easy to use web app that encrypts your conversations. 
				It's open-source, translated into 32 languages and you already know how to use it.

			Cryptocat is free software that aims to provide an open, accessible Instant Messaging environment that encrypts your conversations and works right in your browser. <a class="downloadLink" href="#" target="_blank"></a>.
		</p>
		<p class="picon">&#x43;</p>
		<p>
			Cryptocat is an open source experiment — the goal is to provide the easiest, most accessible way to chat while maintaining your privacy online, <strong>because we believe in Internet privacy.</strong>

			Friends use Cryptocat to talk without revealing messages to a third party. LGBTQ activists use Cryptocat to keep private matters private. Journalists use Cryptocat to keep their stories and research confidential. Cryptocat is made for everyone.

			Cryptocat is not a magic bullet. You should never trust any piece of software with your life, and Cryptocat is no exception. <a href="#warnings" id="warningLink">Read the full list of warnings.</a>

			<h1>What Cryptocat Doesn't Do</h1>
			<p>While Cryptocat aims to offer strongly encrypted, private Instant Messaging, it's important to note what Cryptocat does <i>not</i> protect you against:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Cryptocat does not anonymize you:</strong> While your communications are encrypted, your identity can still be traced since Cryptocat does not mask your IP address. For anonymization, we highly recommend using <a href="https://torproject.org" target="_blank">Tor</a>.</li>
				<li><strong>Cryptocat does not protect against key loggers:</strong> Your messages are encrypted as they go through the wire, but that doesn't mean that your keyboard is necessarily safe. Cryptocat does not protect against hardware or software key loggers which might be snooping on your keyboard strokes and sending them to an undesired tird party.</li>
				<li><strong>Cryptocat does not protect against untrustworthy people:</strong> Parties you're conversing with may still leak your messages without your knowledge. Cryptocat aims to make sure that only the parties you're talking to get your messages, but that doesn't mean these parties are necessarily trustworthy.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1 id="documentation">Open source, open documentation.</h1>
		<p class="picon">&#x46;</p>
		<p>
			Cryptocat is developed under a principle of <strong>radical transparency</strong>. Our code, server configuration, network operations, audits, funding and everything in between is released for review, improvement and scrutiny.
		</p>
		<p class="picon">&#x72;</p>
		<p>
			Our software is openly documented. Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/wiki/" target="_blank">development wiki</a> for threat models, server configurations, architecture lifecycle documents and more.
